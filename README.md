# kuill

This project uses code originally from the [android-quill-delta](https://github.com/volser/android-quill-delta) project.  The dependency
on Google's GSON library was replaced with the more common Jackson JSON library, and the build was changed to be non-Android specific.

This library should work for both Kotlin and Java users, with the caveat that Java users will need the Kotlin runtime jar in order to run.
